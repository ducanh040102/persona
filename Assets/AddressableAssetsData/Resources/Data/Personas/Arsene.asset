    him to save yourself? Death awaits him if you do nothing. Was your previous decision
    a mistake then?

    (No need for mere words. Show me your true feelings.)

    well... I have heeded your resolve. Vow to me. I am thou, thou art I... Thou
    who art willing to perform all sacrilegious acts for thine own justice! Call
    upon my name, and release thy rage! Show the strength of thy will to ascertain
    all on thine own, though thou be chained to Hell itself!"'
